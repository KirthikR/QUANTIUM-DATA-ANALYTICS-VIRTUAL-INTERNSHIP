# FORAGE DATA ANALYTICS VIRTUAL INTERNSHIP PROJECT

## Overview

This virtual internship project provided an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in data analytics within the context of a simulated professional environment. Throughout the internship, I engaged in real-world data analysis tasks, which allowed me to apply and develop my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation. The project was structured to mimic the workflow of a data analyst, enabling me to experience the end-to-end process of extracting insights from raw data and communicating findings effectively.

## Project Details

### Objectives
- Gain practical experience in data analysis techniques.
- Apply statistical methods to extract meaningful insights from datasets.
- Develop proficiency in data visualization tools and techniques.
- Learn how to communicate complex technical findings to non-technical stakeholders.

### Tasks Completed
1. **Data Exploration**: I started by familiarizing myself with the dataset provided, understanding its structure, and identifying potential areas for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing the dataset involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types for consistency.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: I performed descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and correlation analysis to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.
4. **Data Visualization**: Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots were created to represent key findings and insights visually.
5. **Insights Generation**: Based on the analysis results, I derived actionable insights and recommendations for stakeholders, highlighting key trends and outliers.
6. **Documentation**: Throughout the project, I maintained detailed documentation of the analysis process, including methodologies, assumptions, and limitations.
